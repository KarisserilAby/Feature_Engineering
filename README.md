# Feature_Engineering
The Bank Marketing dataset contains the information of the marketing campaigns done by a Portuguese bank requesting 41188 customers to subscribe to their term deposit plan.This dataset consist of 41188 data points and 21 features. Here in this project we are trying to create a classification model that can predict the potential customers who may accept the bank's request to subscribe the term deposit. It is also planned to optimize the model through feature engineering and Recursive Feature elimination so that maximum prediction accuracy is obtained with minimum possible features.
